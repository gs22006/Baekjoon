### 문제 설명

<p>Borcsa has two arrays, each of them containing $N$ non-negative integers.</p>

<p>The numbers in the first array are $A[0],A[1], \dots ,A[N - 1]$ and the numbers in the second array are $B[0],B[1], \dots ,B[N - 1]$. The numbers in both arrays are in increasing order, that is,</p>

<ul>
	<li>$A[0] ≤ A[1] ≤ \dots ≤ A[N - 1]$, and</li>
	<li>$B[0] ≤ B[1] ≤ … ≤ B[N - 1]$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Borcsa really likes arithmetical addition, so for each $i$ from $0$ to $N - 1$ and for each $j$ from $0$ to $N - 1$, inclusive, she computed the sum $A[i] + B[j]$.</p>

<p>Let array $C$ contain all $N^2$ sums computed by Borcsa, sorted in <em>increasing</em> order. Your task is to find the first $N$ values in $C$.</p>
