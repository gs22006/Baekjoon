### 문제 설명

<p>There are $N$ non-negative integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$ satisfying the following inequality $0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_N \le 10^{18}$. Jeehak wants to know the largest possible value of $a_{i+1} - a_i$ where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N-1$. The input integers will not be given directly to Jeehak's program but will be accessible through a special funtion. See sections Implementation of your selected programming language for details.</p>

<p>Help Jeehak to implement a function to return the largest possible value of $a_{i+1} - a_i$ where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N-1$.</p>
