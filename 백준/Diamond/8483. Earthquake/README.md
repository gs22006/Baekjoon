### 문제 설명

<p>The Infinity City is located on an infinite quarterplane. There is an infinite number of sky-scrapers in the city, there is one sky-scraper located at every point with integer coordinates.</p>

<p>One unfortunate day there was an earthquake in the city. There was a huge tectonic crack along the line Ax + By = C and all the sky-scrapers at positions satisfying the inequality Ax + By > C simply disappeared. The city has now become a Finity City with only a finite number of sky-scrapers. But exactly how many?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The only line of input contains three space-separated positive integers A, B, C. They are bounded as follows: A, B ≤ 1 000 000 000, C ≤ min(A, B) × 1 000 000 000.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Your program should output exactly one integer: the number of sky-scrapers in the Finity City.</p>
