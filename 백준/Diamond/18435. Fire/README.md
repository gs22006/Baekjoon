### 문제 설명

<p>There are N districts in JOI Village, numbered from 1 to N. These districts are located in a line. Now, a fire occurs in each district. At time 0, the strength of the fire in the i-th district (1 ≤ i ≤ N) is S<sub>i</sub> (S<sub>i</sub> > 0).</p>

<p>At time 0, the wind blows from the 1st district to the N-th district. For every pair of neighboring districts, if the fire in the upwind district is stronger than the fire in the downwind district at time t (0 ≤ t), the strength of the fire in the downwind district at time t +1 will be the strength of the fire in the upwind district at time t. Otherwise, the strength of the fire in the downwind district at time t +1 and time t are the same. Namely, if the strength of the fire in the i-th district (1 ≤ i ≤ N) at time t (0 ≤ t) is denoted by S<sub>i</sub>(t), we have S<sub>i</sub>(t) = max{S<sub>i−1</sub>(t − 1), S<sub>i</sub>(t − 1)} for every t (1 ≤ t). Here, for any t (0 ≤ t), we put S<sub>0</sub>(t) = 0. For any i (1 ≤ i ≤ N), we put S<sub>i</sub>(0) = S<sub>i</sub>.</p>

<p>You are a firefighter. You have Q plans to extinguish the fire. You are planning to do only one of the Q plans. In the j-th plan (1 ≤ j ≤ Q), you will use fire extinguishing agent for the k-th district for every k with L<sub>j</sub> ≤ k ≤ R<sub>j</sub>, and extinguish the fire in these districts. If the strength of the fire in a district is s, you need s liters of fire extinguishing agent to extinguish the fire in that district. Therefore, the amount of fire extinguishing agent needed for the j-th plan is S<sub>L<sub>j</sub></sub>(T<sub>j</sub>) + S<sub>L<sub>j+1</sub></sub>(T<sub>j</sub>) + · · · + S<sub>R<sub>j</sub></sub> (T<sub>j</sub>) liters. In order to examine the plan to be done, you want to know the amount of fire extinguishing agent needed for each plan.</p>

<p>Write a program which, given the strength of the fire at time 0 and information of fire extinguishing plans, calculates the amount of fire extinguishing agent needed for each plan.</p>

### 입력

### 출력 

 <p>Write Q lines to the standard output. In the j-th line (1 ≤ j ≤ Q), output the amount of fire extinguishing agent needed for the j-th plan.</p>
