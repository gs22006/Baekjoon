### 문제 설명

<p>Gug is preparing a feast for his friends. The feast consists of N plates of food arranged in a single row, with the ith plate from the left giving A<sub>i</sub> points of satisfaction if eaten. As some plates of food might be rotten, it is possible that A<sub>i</sub> is negative.</p>

<p>There are a total of K people involved in the feast, and each person will be assigned a consecutive segment of plates to consume. This segment can possibly be empty. The segments of two people cannot overlap, as food cannot be eaten twice. Gug wishes to assign the plates to his friends such that the sum of satisfaction points of all the plates of food consumed is maximised.</p>
